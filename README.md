# Team-6
Hello and welcome to our project. 
We are InNeeD. 
We help patients to reduce waiting times by giving allocated time slots and live information on waiting rooms status. 
We also help doctors/hospitals to avoid backlog by directing patients to the correct waiting rooms, which reduces the amount of congestion. 
Lastly, we help any users contact the correct helplines by giving them options according to their emergency.
Here we have a simple back-end demo:
The csv file contains a small look into what our database would look like.
The jupyter notebook has the linear regression algorithm that uses the number of patients and the number of doctors to determine waiting times.
